### Hi there 👋

🧑🏻‍💻 I work at [Tadaweb](https://www.tadaweb.com) as a **Machine Learning** and **Core engineer**.

🔭 I've written a bunch of **Rust**, **Go**, **Python** or **C** tools that you can look for, here.

🤝 I contribute(d) to many **free** and **open-source** projects like [ar-OS](https://github.com/ar-OS), [redox-OS](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/) or [cargo-generate](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate/).

💬 Feel free to just create a GitHub issue for questions or if you want some help on a project.

🌍 Please look [here](https://carette.xyz) if you want to contact me.

🌱 If I screw up... I grow!
