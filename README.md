### Hi there 👋

🧑🏻‍💻 I work at [Tadaweb](https://www.tadaweb.com) as a Machine Learning and Core engineer.

🔭 I've written a bunch of Rust, Go, Python and C tools that you can look for, in this github space.

🤝 I contribute(d) to many free and open-source projects like [ar-OS](https://github.com/ar-OS), [redox-OS](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/) or [cargo-generate](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate/).

💬 Feel free to just create a GitHub issue for questions or if you want some help on a Rust project.
