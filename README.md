### Hi there 👋

🧑🏻‍💻 I work as **R&D engineer** on AI/ML projects at [DataThings](https://datathings.com/), Luxembourg.

🔭 I wrote a bunch of **Rust**, **Go**, **Python** or **C** tools that you can look for on my github space.

🤝 I contribute(d) to many **free** and **open-source** projects like [ar-OS](https://github.com/ar-OS), [redox-OS](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/) or [cargo-generate](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate/).

🌍 Please look [here](https://carette.xyz) if you want to contact me.
