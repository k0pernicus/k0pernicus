### Hi there 👋

🧑🏻‍💻 I am a polyglot senior developer, working with **Python**, **Go**, **Rust**, and **Swift**.

🤝 I contribute(d) to many **free** and **open-source** projects like [ar-OS](https://github.com/ar-OS), [redox-OS](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/) or [cargo-generate](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate/).

👾 I am working on my own game engine in **Swift**, **SwiftUI** and **Metal** API to create iOS / iPadOS and macOS games.
